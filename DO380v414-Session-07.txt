#OADP Operator:-
- What is OADP?
  OpenShift API for Data Production (OADP) is RH's native backup and restore framework for OpenShift workload.

- What does OADP protect?
  - OADP backs/restore up:-
    - Kubernetes resources [PODs,Deployment,Service, Route and other CRs).
	- Persistent Volume (via snapshots or file-system backup)
	- OpenShift internal container image (via OpenShift plugin).
	- OpenShift Virtulization resources (via KubeVIrt plugins) [K8s/OCP resources, internal images, PVC- data]

- Core Architecture (Velero-centric Design).
  Central Component: Velero
  - ACt as backup/restore API server.
  - It Orchestrates backups using Plug-ins 
  - Comunications with Kubernetes API, CSI drivers, and object storage.
  
- Supporting Components:-
  - Component 
    ->  Velero -> Backup and Restore engine.
    ->  CSI plug-in -> Volume snapshots
    ->  Data Mover -> MOves snapshots to object storage 
    ->  Kopia  -> Upload and encrypt volume data.
    -> Node agent -> Access node-mounted volumes.
    -> Cloud/Oject plugins -> AWS,Azure, GCP and ODF  etc.

- Kubernetes Resource Backup:-
  What happens during resources backup?
  Velero (It's a POD - openshift-storage).
  1- Export Kubernets Objects (Deployment, secret.yaml , configmap.yaml )
  2- Applies filters (namespace, labels, resource etc ).
  3- Determines correct restore order 
  4- Modify cluster-specfic field.
  
- VOlume Backup:-
  - CSI snapshots backup (Recomm/Prefered):-
    Fast 
	Storage-native 
	Minimal application impact.
	
- File System Backup:-
    When this is used ?
	When storage does NOT support snapshots
	- NFS 
	- Local Stoarge 
	
   How it works:-
    NOde agent mounts volume 
	Kopia read file-system
	Data uploadded to object support.
	
- Application-consistent backup 
  snapshots are crash-consitent, not application-consistent.
  
   OADP <  v1.3 -> Restic 
   OADP >= v1.3 -> Kopia (Default).
   Data Mover required Kopia.
