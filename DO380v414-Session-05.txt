#OIDC Authentication & Group Claims:-
RHSSO (sso.ocp4.example.com)
- Integrate Red Hat Single Sign-On (RHSSO/Keyclock) with OpenShift using OIDC.
- Sync user + groups 
- Authentication via RHSSO 
- Authorization (RBAC) via OpenShift sync group.

# Components involved:-
- Red Hat Single Sign-On (RHSSO):-
  - Acts as OIDC Indentity Provider (IdP)
  - Stores:-
    - Users
    - Groups 
  - Issues:-
    - ID Token
    - Access Token 
    - Group Claim 

- OpenShift Oauth:-
  - Acts as OIDC client
  - Delegates authenication to RHSSO.
  - Creats:-
    - OpenShift users.
	- OpenShift Groups.
  - Enforces RBAC

- external_provides Realm
  - Logical isolation inside RHSSO 
  - Dedicated realms for OpenShift integration 

Realm is a security and identity boundary that contains it's own users,groups,client,roles \
and authenication rules.

==========
Unit-1-# Authentication & Authorization (w.r.t multiple IdPs):-
- Authentication - Oauth/Client Certificate.
- htpasswd (mappingMethod)
- LDAP integration [IDM & RHDS]
- LDAP groups sync (with automated way using cronjobs).
- Client Certificate [Back door entry for cluster-admin and auditor part)
- OpenIDConnect (RHSSO)

Exam:-
- LDAP integration
- Client Certificate

Unit-2-# Backup, Restore, and Migration of Applications with OADP (End user application not for control plane):-
- Export and Import Application Data and Settings:-
  - K8s resources [POD,SVC,RS,Deploy,StatefulSet,route,PVC,SC]
  - Images (w.r.t internal registry)
  
  Container -> images -> registry
  Container -> Storage -> PV/PVC -> SC -> ActualStorage [RBD,CephFS,RGW->MCG = ODF -> Ceph + NooBaa storage)
