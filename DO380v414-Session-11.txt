Unit-3-Part-03-# Node Configuration with Special Purpose Operators.
- What is "Special Purpose Operators" ?
  - Goal:-
    Apply OS-level/node-level settings/changes to OpenSHift nodes using higher-level Operators, 
    instead of only using the Machine Configuration Operators (MCO).
  - Why higher-level Operators?
    MCO is great for many baseline OS configurations, but some workload needs specialized tuning 
	that is better handled by dedicated operator.
	
- MCO vs Special Purpose Operators
  1-) MCO is best for:-
      baseline OS configurations across a group of nodes:-
	  - kernel args/ sysctl baseline (common values).
	  - files, systemd unitts, basic OS configurations.
	  - node reboots and safe rollout via MCP.
	Example:-
	  - You want to ensure all worker nodes have a standard sysctl baseline for networking/database etc.
	  - MCO is a good fir basecause it's Uniform OS policy'.
	  
  2-) Special Purpose Operator are best for:-
      Advanc, workload-aware,hardware-aware and operationaally dynamic tuning such as:-
      - Performance tuning profile (Latency vs Throughput)
      - Hardware discovery and labeling (GPU,SR_IOV, NIC, CPU features etc).
      - Kernel modules lifecycle management (Build/deploy).
    Example:-
      - Only a subset of nodes run "OpenSHift Virtulization" workload (VMs - Based on KubeVirt) and need CPU  
        isolation + real-time tuning.
 
       VMs (Hypervisor - Example:- ESXi, KVM, HyperV etc) 
	   FYI- [Libvirt + QEMU/KVM + VMs] -> Host (Called Hypervisor)
	   
       VMs (Cloud-Native - based on KubeVirt)
       FYI-[Libvirt + QEMU/KVM + VMs] -> COntainer (called as KubeVirt Container).
    
       VM-01 -> KubeVirt Container [ Libvirt + QEMU/KVM + VM ] 
	   VM-02 -> KubeVirt Container [ Libvirt + QEMU/KVM + VM ] 
	   VM-03 -> KubeVirt Container [ Libvirt + QEMU/KVM + VM ] 
	   
	   KubeVirt Container is a POD.
	   

- How an operator works internally:-
  - Runs in a dedicated namespace:-
    1-) Each operator usually runs in a specific namespace (Example - node truning operator namespace).
    2-) This contains:-
       - Operator deployment/pods
       - ServiceAccount + RBAC (premission).
       - Operator-specific CRDs.

-# Node Tuning Operator (NTO) 
    What it does ? Manage NODE-LEVEL Performance turning using ?
	- tuned service + tuned daemon
   
-# Node fauture discovery (NFD):-
   NFD profile each node and discover hardware and OS capabilities such as:-
   - CPU architecture and features falgs.
   - PIC device (GNU,NIC, accelerators).
   - Kernel/OS characte
  	 
-# KMM - Kernel MOdule Management operator
 - KMM manage the lifecycle of "out-of-tree" kernel modules.
   
  FYI- very useful when you need drivers or kernel modules not included by default.

  $ oc debug node/worker01
  # cat /etc/rele<ATB>
  # hostnamectl 
  # chroot /host
  # cat /etc/rele<ATB>
  # hostnamectl

  FYI- 
   - It launches a Mutable RHEL container 
   - Gives you access to debugging tools 
   - Does NOT nodify the host OS (RHEL coreOS).
