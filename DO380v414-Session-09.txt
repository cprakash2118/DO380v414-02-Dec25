Unit-3-# Cluster Partitioning
https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/self-managed-openshift-subscription-guide

- Workload types (w.r.t Applications):-
  1- AI/ML based workload/Applications  (20%)
  2- MicroService workload/Applications (50%)
  3- Lagecy workload/Applications       (30%)   
  
  Solution- Red Hat OpenShift:-
  - OCP cluster [3 master & 100 worker nodes];
  - 20 worker nodes - AI/ML  [ Required HIGH CPU/GPU level hardware ] 
  - 50 worker nodes - MicroService [Standard hardware]
  - 30 worker nodes - Lagecy applications. [Standard - Virtulization supported hardware - KubeVirt]

Problem Statement:-
1- What problem are node pools solving ?
- Applications running on OpenShift "do not have same hardware needs":-
  - Some apps are CPU-intensive 
  - Some need GPU 
  - Some are latency-sensitive 
  - Some are lightweight database or Web apps.
  
  If all workloads run on same tyope of compute nodes the you will face issues like:-
  - Higher cloud billing 
  - Wasted resources
  - Poor performance 
  - Noisy neighbor issues 
  
2- openshift Node types:-
   OCP cluster consist of:-
   2.1- COntrol Plain nodes  
      - COntrol Plain nodes are master node and manage cluster state.
      - Manage CLuster state 
	  - NO not run applications pods on this platform.
      - control node also called master nodes [No end user application]
	  
   2.1 Compute nodes (Worker nodes):-
      - Worker node run application workload called POD.
	  - can be customized on hardware level.
	 

3- What is node pool ?
   Logical grouping of compute nodes with similar hardware and configuration.
   
4- Why node pools matter:- 
  - Hardware-specific workloads
  - Cost Optimization 
5- Noisy neighbor problems.

Labels:-



Machine configuration operator (MCO):-
MachineConfig:-
MachineConfigPool:- 

- RHEL coreOS - Container optimized OS (No Manual Changes on RHEL CoreOS)
- ALL changes via Machine configuration operator (MCO).
- MachineConfig - Are the changes.
- MachineConfigPool - Where the changes (MC) will be deployed [Default - master/worker]
